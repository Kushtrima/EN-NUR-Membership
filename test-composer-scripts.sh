echo "🧪 Testing Composer Scripts Issue & Fix"
echo "========================================"

echo ""
echo "📋 Problem Analysis:"
echo "When 'composer install' runs, it triggers these scripts from composer.json:"

# Extract the problematic scripts
echo ""
echo "❌ Problematic scripts that cause the error:"
grep -A 3 "post-create-project-cmd" composer.json | sed 's/^/   /'

echo ""
echo "💡 Why this fails during Docker build:"
echo "   - php artisan key:generate needs APP_KEY env var"
echo "   - php artisan migrate needs database connection"
echo "   - Environment variables aren't available during Docker build"
echo "   - Database isn't running during Docker build"

echo ""
echo "✅ Our Solution:"
echo "   - Use 'composer install --no-scripts' to skip these scripts"
echo "   - Run necessary Laravel setup in startup script at runtime"
echo "   - Environment variables and database are available at runtime"

echo ""
echo "🔍 Verification:"
echo "   - Dockerfile uses --no-scripts: $(grep -c 'no-scripts' Dockerfile) occurrence(s)"
echo "   - Startup script handles Laravel setup: $(grep -c 'php artisan' docker-startup.sh) commands"

echo "🎯 Conclusion: The fix is logically sound and should resolve the issue!"
