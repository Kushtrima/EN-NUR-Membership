# 🔒 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System

## Overview
The EN NUR - MEMBERSHIP application now implements a comprehensive role-based access control system that ensures users only see and access their own data, while admins have appropriate oversight capabilities.

## 🎭 User Roles

### 1. **User** (`user`)
- **Default role** for new registrations
- **Limited access** to personal data only
- **Cannot see** community statistics or other users' information

### 2. **Admin** (`admin`)
- **Enhanced access** to community overview
- **Can view** all users and payments
- **Cannot modify** super admin accounts
- **Can manage** regular users and payments

### 3. **Super Admin** (`super_admin`)
- **Full system access**
- **Can manage** all users including admins
- **Can assign** any role to any user
- **Complete oversight** of the system

## 🛡️ Security Implementation

### Dashboard Separation
- **Users**: Personal dashboard with only their own statistics
- **Admins**: Community dashboard with full statistics + personal summary
- **Super Admins**: Same as admin with additional management capabilities

### Data Access Controls

#### User Access:
```php
// Users can only see their own data
$user->payments()->where('user_id', auth()->id())
```

#### Admin Access:
```php
// Admins can see all community data
Payment::with('user')->get()
User::with('payments')->get()
```

#### Authorization Checks:
```php
// Payment receipt download
if ($payment->user_id !== auth()->id()) {
    abort(403, 'You can only download your own receipts.');
}

// Export functionality
if (!auth()->user()->isSuperAdmin()) {
    return redirect()->back()->with('error', 'Only super administrators can export other users\' payments.');
}
```

## 📊 Dashboard Features by Role

### User Dashboard (`dashboard.user`)
- ✅ **Membership Status** with expiry tracking
- ✅ **Personal Statistics** (total paid, donations, payments)
- ✅ **Payment History** (own payments only)
- ✅ **Quick Actions** (make payment, export history, profile)
- ❌ **No community statistics**
- ❌ **No other users' data**

### Admin Dashboard (`dashboard.admin`)
- ✅ **Community Overview** with full statistics
- ✅ **Admin Quick Actions** (admin panel, all payments, all users, export data)
- ✅ **Personal Summary** (admin's own payments)
- ✅ **All community data** access

## 🔐 Route Protection

### User Routes (All authenticated users)
```php
Route::middleware('auth')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/payments/export/form', [PaymentExportController::class, 'showUserExportForm']);
    Route::get('/payments/{payment}/receipt', [PaymentController::class, 'downloadUserReceipt']);
});
```

### Admin Routes (Admin + Super Admin)
```php
Route::middleware(['auth', 'admin'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/admin/dashboard', [AdminController::class, 'dashboard']);
    Route::get('/admin/users', [AdminController::class, 'users']);
    Route::get('/admin/payments', [AdminController::class, 'payments']);
});
```

### Super Admin Routes (Super Admin only)
```php
Route::middleware(['auth', 'admin', 'super_admin'])->group(function () {
    Route::patch('/admin/users/{user}/role', [AdminController::class, 'updateUserRole']);
    Route::delete('/admin/users/{user}', [AdminController::class, 'deleteUser']);
});
```

## 🎯 Navigation System

### User Navigation
- 🏠 Dashboard (personal)
- 💳 Payments (create new)
- 📊 My Reports (export own data)
- ⚙️ Profile (settings)

### Admin Navigation
- 🏠 Dashboard (community + personal)
- 💳 Payments (create new)
- 🛡️ Admin Panel (highlighted)
- ⚙️ Profile (settings)

## 🔍 Data Isolation Examples

### Payment History
**User sees:**
```php
auth()->user()->payments()->sortByDesc('created_at')->take(10)
```

**Admin sees:**
```php
Payment::with('user')->orderBy('created_at', 'desc')->paginate(20)
```

### Statistics
**User sees:**
```php
$userStats = [
    'total_paid' => $user->payments()->where('status', 'completed')->sum('amount') / 100,
    'completed_payments' => $user->payments()->where('status', 'completed')->count(),
    // Only personal data
];
```

**Admin sees:**
```php
$stats = [
    'total_users' => User::count(),
    'total_revenue' => Payment::where('status', 'completed')->sum('amount') / 100,
    // Full community data
];
```

## 🧪 Testing the System

### Test User Access:
1. Login as a user with role `user`
2. Verify dashboard shows only personal information
3. Try accessing `/admin/dashboard` → Should be blocked
4. Check payment export only shows own payments

### Test Admin Access:
1. Login as admin with role `admin` or `super_admin`
2. Verify dashboard shows community statistics
3. Access admin panel successfully
4. Verify can see all users and payments

### Test Data Isolation:
1. User A cannot see User B's payment receipts
2. User cannot access admin export functionality
3. Admin can access all data appropriately

## 🚀 Benefits Achieved

1. **Data Privacy**: Users can only access their own information
2. **Role Separation**: Clear distinction between user and admin capabilities
3. **Security**: Proper authorization checks on all sensitive operations
4. **User Experience**: Tailored dashboards for each role
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new roles or modify permissions

## 📝 Implementation Summary

- ✅ **Separate dashboards** for users and admins
- ✅ **Role-based navigation** with appropriate menu items
- ✅ **Data access controls** on all payment and user operations
- ✅ **Authorization middleware** protecting admin routes
- ✅ **Personal vs community statistics** properly separated
- ✅ **Export functionality** respects user boundaries
- ✅ **Receipt downloads** limited to own payments only

The system now ensures that regular users have a clean, personal experience while admins maintain necessary oversight capabilities, all with proper security boundaries in place.
